README: run_analysis.R; tidy_data.txt
==================================================================
This script uses data from the UCI HAR Dataset.
It reads all of the necessary files and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
A snippet of code that cleans up the features names has been included. It capitalizes the "M" in "mean", the "S" in "Std" and removes the parenthesis as well as the hyphens.
The activity names have also been replaced with descriptive names.
From the run_analysis.R script, a tidy_data.txt script is written that encompasses the above changes.
