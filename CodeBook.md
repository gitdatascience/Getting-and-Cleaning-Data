##Data Dictionary - UCI HAR Dataset

###Feature Selection
From the features_info.txt from the original UCI HAR Dataset:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

###Variables used against these signals include:
mean(): Mean Value
std(): 	Standard Deviation

###Transformations to clean up feature column names
a. removed "()"
b. capitalized "M" in "mean"
c. capitalized "S" in "std"
d. removed "-" and replaced with ""

###Transformations against activity_labels.txt
a. replaced generic column id name to "ActivityID"
b. replaced generic column name to "ActivityName"
c. replaced row values ids with corresponding activity name in tidy_data.txt
	1 WALKING
	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 SITTING
	5 STANDING
	6 LAYING

###Transformations against subject_train.txt
###and subject_test.txt
a. replaced generic column name to "Subject"

###Columns preceding features
